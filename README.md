# UI CHALLENGES - Flutter :rocket:

In this repository I will post my progress, my idea is to create 100 different UI designs, we will see what the future holds for me.

## Motivation

The main motivation to start this project is to improve my flutter knowledge, at this moment I'm enthusiast and lover the flutter.
I'm a mobile developer from Colombia, my main knowledge is Android and Nodejs, at this moment I think flutter is a good opportunity for the future.
